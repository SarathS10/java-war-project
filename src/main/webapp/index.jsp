<h2>Hey thangam, </h2>
<h2>I hope everything is alright from your side! You have small surprise for you in last line of this message </h2>
<h2>Every moment without you feels like an eternity “ Miss You So Much”. I want to hug you tight and say “SORRY” for all the mistake I med…</h2>
<h2> Everything is fine when we are talking daily but now feels incomplete without you. Nothing more precious than the time I spend with you. Two things I can’t control: “My smile when I see you”& “My tears when I miss you” </h2>
<h2>•	My relation with you is not like RAIN which comes and go away; My relation is like AIR sometimes silent but Always Around You.</h2>
